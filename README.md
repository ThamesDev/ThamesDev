- Hi, I’m @ThamesDev
- I’m interested in music, animals, obviously programming, Linux and much more!
- I’m currently learning C, but I'm already quite proficient with Python. I love that they've finally added a switch case function, weird as the syntax may be!
- I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, but hmu if you have something you think I'll find interesting. I will work for free: the catch is that I   will do so on my own terms, in my free time. This may take ages.
- How to reach me: just use GitHub. Open an issue in my personal repo or something, I don't really mind.
